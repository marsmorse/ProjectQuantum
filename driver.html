      Project Quantum

  Planning Document
  </br>
    For our project we’re planning to create an interactive information display for a product (maybe ourselves). 
    We want to move the user from 3d scene to 3d scene by moving the camera to different scenes in a 3d world 
    or rendering new ones, with the user having the ability to create and destroy objects within the scene. 
    Within each scene we plan to exhibit a host of various effects and user interactions. We plan to have different text 
    in each scene with a clickable hud for navigation. The HUD could be a shape or just a < > html text to navigate from 
    one scene to the next. To navigate we plan to use animation with keyframing. We are going for a clean and simple aesthetic
    with warm colors, low poly object designs, and soft lighting. We want the experience to feel friendly and approachable. 
    Project Quantum is designed to fluidly move users between 3d scenes to help improve the users understanding of a
    product or idea.  

  </br>
Description of each of (team members x2) advanced methods you (plan to) have implemented.
	Interactive HUD: We are going to use this for navigation. There can be a markers or buttons to click to get from 
    one screen to the next. We will be able to use this to make sure the user can get around the project.
	Object Clicking: We want the users to be able to move the objects they are looking at. We can have a cube for 
    example with text on one side, with the user clicking we can drag the cube to look at another side of the cube which 
    could have more information on it. User clicking can also move the object to the side in order to see it from different angles.
	Fog: We want to create cool effects around our objects to make sure they aren’t bland and boring. More than just fog we 
    want to make our scenes interesting and worth looking at. We can use these effects to also make the intros to our scene 
    interesting, if the fog clears to reveal the next object or if the object catches on fire as we move to the next object.
	Shadows: We want to make the scenes look as realistic as possible. Having shadows on the objects we are going to create 
    will give them depth and also give them more realistic aspects. 
	Particle Systems: Like the atmospheric effects we want the scenes to look nice and interesting. 
    There will be multiple particles that we can add to the scenes whether it is at the start or end or in between. 
    These particles will be for aesthetics only.
	Alpha Blending: We want to alpha blend as we are moving the camera from one scene to another. 
    We think this would be a cool feature because it shows the image fading away while we are moving towards another scene.
  </br>
For the scenes our to do list is as follows:
 -were going to have limit camera movement to be closely around our scene.
 -add click and drag interactions
 	- add smoke and other visual effects mentioned about
	- add a hud for easy starting animations
	-make scene from OBJ and WebGL shapes
	-add shadows to your shaders
	-possibly add collision and maybe raytracing foreground/background if we get There
  -possibly add a few light sources for a richer lighting environment
</br>
For animations
	-possibly change from animating camera to animating scene to avoid having to animate light sources as well
	-index fading from and to scenes with deletion after complete fade on scene exhibit
	-Already implemented linear interpolation for animations
	-render new scene on start of a transition
	-make class to handle this???
	-possibly add effects or change background color
	
    </br>
    
How to interact with our creation:
	X will shift the camera to a viewing angle for the next scene. C will create the shapes included in a given scene. 
    T will terminate all of the objects in the current scene. You can look around with the mouse.
